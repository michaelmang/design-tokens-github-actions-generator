## The motivation

I'm a visual person. I'm a UI developer.

When I went through the process of coming up with GitHub Action workflows for [my series on design tokens](https://www.michaelmang.dev/blog/introduction-to-design-tokens), I went googling for a "GitHub Actions generator."

I wanted to have a visual tool that I could interact with that would write the commands using [GitHub Actions syntax](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions) to a YAML file.

I wasn't able to find a tool like, so I started to make one for my own.

Turns out, it's a lot of work to handle all the syntax. For example, the `on` property can a large combination of [events that trigger the workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows).

I decided to cut the scope of my initial idea and just create a visual tool that generates the YAML files for [the workflows I created in my design tokens ](https://github.com/michaelmang/style-dictionary/tree/consuming-design-tokens-from-style-dictionary-with-github-actions/.github/workflows).

## Roadmap ðŸš€

### My Roadmap
- [x] Transform Design Tokens On Update
- [x] Deliver Design Tokens To Consuming Applications ~ in the works

### If People Like the Idea/Wanted to Help Contribute
- [] Refactor
- [] Add More Control Over Options (updating the virtual environment, Node versions, etc.)
- [] Create More Design Tokens Automations Based On Community Input
- [] Have A Single Page for Doing the Automations
- [] Expand Automations Beyond Design Tokens
- [] Allow The User To Create A Workflow W/O An Automation (map forms to the GitHub Actions syntax)
- [] Allow The User To Select From Pre-Defined Actions In the Marketplace
- [] Whatever else would be of interest
